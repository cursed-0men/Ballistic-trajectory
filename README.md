## 🔍 Introduction
This project simulates the motion of a projectile using real-world physics. By adjusting parameters such as the launch angle, velocity, and height, users can visualize the resulting trajectory.

---

## ✨ Features
- 📈 Simulates projectile motion with precision.
- 🎨 Graphical visualization of trajectories.
- 🧮 Parameter-based customization:
  - **Initial velocity**: Adjust the speed of the projectile.
  - **Launch angle**: Change the angle of projection.
  - **Height**: Modify the initial height of launch.
